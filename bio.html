<p>Hello! My name is Fallon Shaughnessy, and I am an Engineering Psychology major, Film and Media Studies minor at Tufts University. I am also a member of the Tufts Field Hockey team.</p>

<p>Much like athletics, human factors is a team sport that combines a vast number of disciplines, including engineering, psychology, and design. I believe understanding the user experience is crucial for the design process. With the rapid increase in technology, particularly online, there is a pressing need to create better interfaces and products for the people who interact with them.</p>
