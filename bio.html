<p>Hello! My name is Fallon Shaughnessy, and I am a Human Factors / Engineering Psychology major, Film and Media Studies minor at Tufts University.</p>

<p>In addition to my academic work, I am the captain of the upcoming 2018 Tufts University field hockey team. As a member of the team, I was a 2016 NESCAC Champion and a 2016 NCAA DIII National Finalist.</p>

<p>A native of Acton, Massachusetts, I attended Acton-Boxborough Regional High School where I played field hockey, lacrosse and track. As a member of the field hockey team, I was a 2012 and 2014 MIAA DI State Champion, for the latter of which I was team captain. Off the field, I coached youth lacrosse and volunteered at the Acton Memorial Library in the children's department.</p>

<p>Much like athletics, human factors is a team sport that combines a vast number of disciplines, including engineering, psychology, and design. I believe understanding the user experience is crucial for the design process. With the rapid increase in technology, particularly online, there is a pressing need to create better interfaces and products for the people who interact with them.</p>
