					<h4><b>THE TEAM</b></h4>
					<p class="margin-tb-10"> <i> <b>Six</b> senior undergraduate Tufts students: <b>Two</b> Human Factors Engineers, <b>One</b> Computer Engineer, <b>Two</b> Electrical Engineers, and <b>One</b> Computer Scientist </i></p>

					<h4><b>THE SPONSORS</b></h4>
					<p class="margin-tb-10"> <i>Wonder Workshop, Tufts University School of Engineering</i></p>

					<h4><b>THE OBJECTIVE</b></h4>
					<p class="margin-tb-10"> <i> To build a desktop-based user interface that allows two-way communication between the Cue Robot and the Micro:bit for middle school students to learn computer science in a fun and interactive manner.</i></p>

					<h4><b>MY ROLE</b></h4>
					<p class="margin-tb-10"> <i> To provide user research, to design and conduct usability tests, and to organize and relay findings to the engineering team for improvements in future iteration.</i></p>

						<h5 class="font-lite-black"><b>USER RESEARCH</b></h5>

						<h4><b>FIELD EXPERT INTERVIEWS</b></h4>
						<h5 class="font-yellow"><b>CONTEXT</b></h5>
						<p class="font-semi-white margin-b-30">In order to grasp the context of computer science learning in middle schools, we needed to understand the educators and creators of coding curriculum. We read educator blogs, twitter posts, and teacher forums. We familiarized ourselves with these online communities of educators and creators. We then sought out the experts in these communities for phone and e-mail based interviews. We spoke to middle school educators with diverse backgrounds in both robotics and computer science, as well as curriculum creators and facilitators.</p>
						<h5 class="font-yellow"><b>FINDINGS</b></h5>
						<p class="font-semi-white margin-b-30"> <b>Need for Inclusivity: </b><i>Not all students learn at the same pace.</i> Our user interface must accommodate a range of intellectual abilities.</p>
						<p class="font-semi-white margin-b-30"> <b>Need for Excitement: </b><i>Students get bored.</i> The most effective technologies induce excitement and  participation. Our user interface must provide several kinds of stimuli (haptic, visual and audio) and provide appropriate feedback.</p>
						<p class="font-semi-white margin-b-30"> <b>Need for Collaboration: </b><i>Robots are expensive. Engineering classes and clubs are often not prioritized.</i> Most schools lack sufficient funding to bring in technology, like robots, into the classroom. Funding frequently comes from external sources, like PTA's, but they often only provide a few per class. Our user interface must permit multiple students to work together simultaneously.</p>

						<h4><b>PERSONAE CREATION</b></h4>
						<h5 class="font-yellow"><b>JENNA</b></h5>
						<p class="font-semi-white margin-b-30">Jenna is in the 6th grade and has seen her older brother coding a lot. She is shy but excited by the idea of computer science and robotics. She sometimes struggles to understand concepts in a traditional classroom lecturing style, and prefers visual learning and physical activities.</p>
						<h5 class="font-yellow"><b>CRAIG</b></h5>
						<p class="font-semi-white margin-b-30">Craig is computer science savant. He has had the luxury of attending an after-school computer science club and is ahead of the curve academically. He gets impatient easily, and is bored by the pace of the material taught in class. Craig seeks accelerated learning that matches his experience and ability.</p>
						<h5 class="font-yellow"><b>TOM</b></h5>
						<p class="font-semi-white margin-b-30">Tom is a 7th grade engineering teacher at Chatham Middle School. He loves teaching this age group because they are so impressionable and excited by learning. He wants his students to have the proper tools and technologies they deserve, spending a lot of his energy advocating and requesting for funding that often is unavailable. The devices that he does have to help him teach often need software updates or become obsolete.</p>

						<h2><b>Phase 2</b></h2>
						<h5 class="font-lite-black"><b>USABILITY TESTING</b></h5>
					</div>
				</div><!-- container -->

				<div class="col-sm-8 margin-b-50">
							<h4><b>TESTING SITE </b></h4>
							<h5 class="font-yellow"><b>MUSEUM OF SCIENCE, BOSTON</b></h5>
							<h6 class="font-lite-black">PROS</h6>
							<p class="margin-tb-10"> - Incredible support from their engineering and curriculum development teams on-site </p>
							<p class="margin-tb-10"> - Access to many users in a short amount of time </p>
							<p class="margin-tb-10"> - Diversity in backgrounds and ability of participants </p>
							<h6 class="font-lite-black">CONS</h6>
							<p class="margin-tb-10"> - Reliance on volunteers only </p>
							<p class="margin-b-30"> - Strict IRB/Museum rules, which prohibited filming and any quantitative data that singled out participants</p>

							<h4><b>TESTING METHODS</b></h4>
							<h5 class="font-yellow"><b>Exploratory</b></h5>
							<h6 class="font-lite-black"><i>Participants asked to use the devices without any facilitator intervention, providing commentary and suggestions to impove the system as they explore the features.</i></h6>
							<h5 class="font-yellow"><b>Directional</b></h5>
							<h6 class="font-lite-black"><i>Participants asked to make the devices complete specific actions while thinking out loud. Sample tests shown below.</i></h6>

							<p><img src="images/One.png" style="width: 100%;"></p>
							<p><img src="images/Two.png" style="width: 100%;"></p>
							<p><img src="images/Three.png" style="width: 100%;"></p>


							<h4><b>TAKEAWAYS</b></h4>
							<p class="margin-b-30"> <b>People are Impatient.</b><i> Latency causes problems.</i> Our early tests showed a pattern of users who pressed buttons multiple times before the device had a chance to complete the previous action. We were able to resolve this by bringing the latency down to less than a second, as well as re-work the code to allow students to override the previous action with a new command.</p>
							<p class=" margin-b-30"> <b>Wording is Important.</b><i> Users want absolute clarity.</i> We received many questions throughout testing sessions regarding the language of our user interface commands (i.e. "What's a string?" "Which button lets me turn the robot to the right?"). We resolved this by adding hovering info boxes that give descriptive explanations of what each command does.</p>
							<p class="margin-b-30"> <b>Students are Excited by Robots in School.</b><i> The vast majority of participants reported that the use of a robot in class would be beneficial to their learning.</i> Our users overall had a very positive experience using our system and would enjoy an interactive learning curriculum like the modules we provided in place of traditional teaching methods.</p>
