					<h4><b>THE TEAM</b></h4>
					<p class="margin-tb-10"> <i> <b>Six</b> senior undergraduate Tufts students: <b>Two</b> Human Factors Engineers, <b>One</b> Computer Engineer, <b>Two</b> Electrical Engineers, and <b>One</b> Computer Scientist </i></p>

					<h4><b>THE SPONSORS</b></h4>
					<p class="margin-tb-10"> <i>Wonder Workshop, Tufts University School of Engineering</i></p>

					<h4><b>THE OBJECTIVE</b></h4>
					<p class="margin-tb-10"> <i> To build a desktop-based user interface that allows two-way communication between the Cue Robot and the Micro:bit for middle school students to learn computer science in a fun and interactive manner.</i></p>

					<h4><b>MY ROLE</b></h4>
					<p class="margin-tb-10"> <i> To provide user research, to design and conduct usability tests, and to organize and relay findings to the engineering team for improvements in future iteration.</i></p>

						<h4><b>FIELD EXPERT INTERVIEWS</b></h4>
						<h5 class="font-yellow"><b>CONTEXT</b></h5>
						<p class="font-semi-white margin-b-30">In order to grasp the context of computer science learning in middle schools, we needed to understand the educators and creators of coding curriculum. We read educator blogs, twitter posts, and teacher forums. We familiarized ourselves with these online communities of educators and creators. We then sought out the experts in these communities for phone and e-mail based interviews. We spoke to middle school educators with diverse backgrounds in both robotics and computer science, as well as curriculum creators and facilitators.</p>
						<h5 class="font-yellow"><b>FINDINGS</b></h5>
						<p class="font-semi-white margin-b-30"> <b>Need for Inclusivity: </b><i>Not all students learn at the same pace.</i> Our user interface must accommodate a range of intellectual abilities.</p>
						<p class="font-semi-white margin-b-30"> <b>Need for Excitement: </b><i>Students get bored.</i> The most effective technologies induce excitement and  participation. Our user interface must provide several kinds of stimuli (haptic, visual and audio) and provide appropriate feedback.</p>
						<p class="font-semi-white margin-b-30"> <b>Need for Collaboration: </b><i>Robots are expensive. Engineering classes and clubs are often not prioritized.</i> Most schools lack sufficient funding to bring in technology, like robots, into the classroom. Funding frequently comes from external sources, like PTA's, but they often only provide a few per class. Our user interface must permit multiple students to work together simultaneously.</p>

						<h4><b>PERSONAE CREATION</b></h4>
						<h5 class="font-yellow"><b>JENNA</b></h5>
						<p class="font-semi-white margin-b-30">Jenna is in the 6th grade and has seen her older brother coding a lot. She is shy but excited by the idea of computer science and robotics. She sometimes struggles to understand concepts in a traditional classroom lecturing style, and prefers visual learning and physical activities.</p>
						<h5 class="font-yellow"><b>CRAIG</b></h5>
						<p class="font-semi-white margin-b-30">Craig is computer science savant. He has had the luxury of attending an after-school computer science club and is ahead of the curve academically. He gets impatient easily, and is bored by the pace of the material taught in class. Craig seeks accelerated learning that matches his experience and ability.</p>
						<h5 class="font-yellow"><b>TOM</b></h5>
						<p class="font-semi-white margin-b-30">Tom is a 7th grade engineering teacher at Chatham Middle School. He loves teaching this age group because they are so impressionable and excited by learning. He wants his students to have the proper tools and technologies they deserve, spending a lot of his energy advocating and requesting for funding that often is unavailable. The devices that he does have to help him teach often need software updates or become obsolete.</p>

						<h4><b>SENIOR CAPSTONE PROJECT</b></h4>
						<h5 class="font-yellow"><b>WONDER WORKSHOP</b></h5>
						<h6 class="margin-t-10">SAN MATEO, CA</h6>
						<h6 class="margin-t-10">SEPTEMBER 2018 - MAY 2019</h6>
						<p class="font-semi-white margin-tb-30">Wonder Workshop is a small company in Silicon Valley that creates educational robots for elementary and middle school students learning computer science. Our team, which consisted of two electrical, two computer science, and two human factors engineers, was tasked with the project of creating a new lesson module that utilized the companyâ€™s newest robot, Cue, by creating a desktop-based user interface.</p>
						<ul class="list margin-b-30">
							<li>Interviewed computer science educators across the United States and Canada who use robotics to teach in their classrooms</li>
							<li>Collaborated with computer science curriculum developers to better grasp the needs of our users and to create requirements for our engineering team </li>
							<li>Performed user testing at the Museum of Science in Boston on middle school aged children, utilizing both exploratory and directional testing methods</li>
							<li>Relayed key insights discovered from these tests to our team to better inform the next iteration of our user interface</li>
						</ul>
